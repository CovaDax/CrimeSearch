Perinatal intensive care services are critical to the well-being and development of a healthy society and represent a constructive, cost-beneficial, and essential investment in the future of our state. Therefore, it is the intent of the Legislature to develop a regional perinatal intensive care centers program. The Legislature further intends that development of such program not reduce or dilute the current financial commitment of the state, as indicated through appropriation, to the existing regional perinatal intensive care centers. It is also the intent of the Legislature that any additional centers authorized under s. 383.19 after July 1, 1993, not receive payments under a disproportionate share program for regional perinatal intensive care centers authorized under chapter 409 unless specific appropriations are provided to expand such payments to additional hospitals.</span></span><div class="History"><span class="HistoryTitle">History.</span><span class="EmDash">&#x2014;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="HistoryText">s. 1, ch. 76-54; s. 1, ch. 77-171; s. 1, ch. 94-140; s. 1, ch. 2012-33.</span></div></div><div class="Section"><span class="SectionNumber">383.16&#x2003;</span><span class="Catchline"><span xml:space="preserve" class="CatchlineText">Definitions; ss. 383.15-383.21.</span><span class="EmDash">&#x2014;</span></span><span class="SectionBody"><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">As used in ss. 383.15-383.21, the term:</span><div class="Subsection"><span class="Number">(1)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">“Department” means the Department of Health.</span></div><div class="Subsection"><span class="Number">(2)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">“Regional perinatal intensive care center” or “center” means a unit designated by the department, located within a hospital, and specifically designed to provide a full range of health services to its patients.</span></div><div class="Subsection"><span class="Number">(3)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">“Patient” means a woman who is experiencing a high-risk pregnancy and who has been declared financially and medically eligible or a newborn infant who needs intensive care and who is declared financially and medically eligible.</span></div></span><div class="History"><span class="HistoryTitle">History.</span><span class="EmDash">&#x2014;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="HistoryText">s. 2, ch. 76-54; s. 1, ch. 77-171; s. 1, ch. 79-351; s. 1, ch. 85-225; s. 2, ch. 94-140; s. 61, ch. 97-101.</span></div></div><div class="Section"><span class="SectionNumber">383.17&#x2003;</span><span class="Catchline"><span xml:space="preserve" class="CatchlineText">Regional perinatal intensive care centers program; authority.</span><span class="EmDash">&#x2014;</span></span><span class="SectionBody"><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">The department may contract with health care providers in establishing and maintaining centers in accordance with ss. 383.15-383.21.

At the same time, the Legislature, recognizing that the primary focus of first responders is to carry out their assigned duties, intends to increase awareness of the possible causes of Sudden Unexpected Infant Death, but in no way expand or take away from their duties. Further, the Legislature recognizes the importance of a multidisciplinary investigation and standardized investigative protocols in cases of Sudden Unexpected Infant Death.
