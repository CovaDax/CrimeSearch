In the event that the owner’s lien does not have priority over all other liens, the sale proceeds shall be held for the benefit of the holders of those liens having priority. A notice of the amount of the sale proceeds shall be delivered by the owner to the tenant or secured lienholders in person or by first-class mail with a certificate of mailing to their last known addresses. If the tenant or the secured lienholders do not claim the sale proceeds within 2 years after the date of sale, the proceeds shall be deemed abandoned, and the owner shall have no further obligation with regard to the payment of the proceeds.</span></div></span><div class="History"><span class="HistoryTitle">History.</span><span class="EmDash">&#x2014;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="HistoryText">s. 1, ch. 79-404; s. 5, ch. 82-151; s. 3, ch. 92-36; s. 4, ch. 93-238; s. 454, ch. 95-147; s. 15, ch. 2002-1; s. 2, ch. 2012-175.</span></div></div><div class="Section"><span class="SectionNumber">83.808&#x2003;</span><span class="Catchline"><span xml:space="preserve" class="CatchlineText">Contracts.</span><span class="EmDash">&#x2014;</span></span><span class="SectionBody"><div class="Subsection"><span class="Number">(1)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">Nothing in ss. 83.801-83.809 shall be construed as in any manner impairing or affecting the right of parties to create liens by special contract or agreement nor shall it in any manner impair or affect any other lien arising at common law, in equity, or by any statute of this state or any other lien not provided for in s. 83.805.</span></div><div class="Subsection"><span class="Number">(2)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">A rental agreement or an application for a rental agreement must contain a provision disclosing whether the applicant is a member of the uniformed services as that term is defined in 10 U.S.C. s. 101(a)(5).</span></div></span><div class="History"><span class="HistoryTitle">History.</span><span class="EmDash">&#x2014;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="HistoryText">s. 6, ch. 82-151; s. 3, ch. 2012-175.</span></div></div><div class="Section"><span class="SectionNumber">83.809&#x2003;</span><span class="Catchline"><span xml:space="preserve" class="CatchlineText">Application of act.</span><span class="EmDash">&#x2014;</span></span><span class="SectionBody"><div class="Subsection"><span class="Number">(1)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">Nothing in this act shall be construed as in any manner impairing or affecting the right of parties to create additional rights, duties, and obligations in and by virtue of a rental agreement.
