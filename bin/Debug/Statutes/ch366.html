Reduction in, and control of, the growth rates of electric consumption and of weather-sensitive peak demand are of particular importance. The Legislature further finds that the Florida Public Service Commission is the appropriate agency to adopt goals and approve plans related to the promotion of demand-side renewable energy systems and the conservation of electric energy and natural gas usage. The Legislature directs the commission to develop and adopt overall goals and authorizes the commission to require each utility to develop plans and implement programs for increasing energy efficiency and conservation and demand-side renewable energy systems within its service area, subject to the approval of the commission. Since solutions to our energy problems are complex, the Legislature intends that the use of solar energy, renewable energy sources, highly efficient systems, cogeneration, and load-control systems be encouraged. Accordingly, in exercising its jurisdiction, the commission shall not approve any rate or rate structure which discriminates against any class of customers on account of the use of such facilities, systems, or devices. This expression of legislative intent shall not be construed to preclude experimental rates, rate structures, or programs. The Legislature further finds and declares that ss. 366.80-366.85 and 403.519 are to be liberally construed in order to meet the complex problems of reducing and controlling the growth rates of electric consumption and reducing the growth rates of weather-sensitive peak demand; increasing the overall efficiency and cost-effectiveness of electricity and natural gas production and use; encouraging further development of demand-side renewable energy systems; and conserving expensive resources, particularly petroleum fuels.</span></span><div class="History"><span class="HistoryTitle">History.</span><span class="EmDash">&#x2014;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="HistoryText">s. 5, ch. 80-65; s. 2, ch. 81-318; ss. 14, 20, 22, ch. 89-292; s. 4, ch. 91-429; s. 38, ch. 2008-227.</span></div></div><div class="Section"><span class="SectionNumber">366.82&#x2003;</span><span class="Catchline"><span xml:space="preserve" class="CatchlineText">Definition; goals; plans; programs; annual reports; energy audits.</span><span class="EmDash">&#x2014;</span></span><span class="SectionBody"><div class="Subsection"><span class="Number">(1)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">For the purposes of ss. 366.80-366.85 and 403.519:</span><div class="Paragraph"><span class="Number">(a)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">“Utility” means any person or entity of whatever form which provides electricity or natural gas at retail to the public, specifically including municipalities or instrumentalities thereof and cooperatives organized under the Rural Electric Cooperative Law and specifically excluding any municipality or instrumentality thereof, any cooperative organized under the Rural Electric Cooperative Law, or any other person or entity providing natural gas at retail to the public whose annual sales volume is less than 100 million therms or any municipality or instrumentality thereof and any cooperative organized under the Rural Electric Cooperative Law providing electricity at retail to the public whose annual sales as of July 1, 1993, to end-use customers is less than 2,000 gigawatt hours.</span></div><div class="Paragraph"><span class="Number">(b)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">“Demand-side renewable energy” means a system located on a customer’s premises generating thermal or electric energy using Florida renewable energy resources and primarily intended to offset all or part of the customer’s electricity requirements provided such system does not exceed 2 megawatts.</span></div></div><div class="Subsection"><span class="Number">(2)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">The commission shall adopt appropriate goals for increasing the efficiency of energy consumption and increasing the development of demand-side renewable energy systems, specifically including goals designed to increase the conservation of expensive resources, such as petroleum fuels, to reduce and control the growth rates of electric consumption, to reduce the growth rates of weather-sensitive peak demand, and to encourage development of demand-side renewable energy resources.
