The state board and the department, as appropriate, are authorized to cash out a de minimis account of a member who has been terminated from Florida Retirement System covered employment for a minimum of 6 calendar months. A de minimis account is an account containing employer and employee contributions and accumulated earnings of not more than $5,000 made under the provisions of this chapter. Such cash-out must be a complete lump-sum liquidation of the account balance, subject to the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, or a lump-sum direct rollover distribution paid directly to the custodian of an eligible retirement plan, as defined by the Internal Revenue Code, on behalf of the member. Any nonvested accumulations and associated service credit, including amounts transferred to the suspense account of the Florida Retirement System Investment Plan Trust Fund authorized under s. 121.4501(6), shall be forfeited upon payment of any vested benefit to a member or beneficiary, except for de minimis distributions or minimum required distributions as provided under this section. If any financial instrument issued for the payment of retirement benefits under this section is not presented for payment within 180 days after the last day of the month in which it was originally issued, the third-party administrator or other duly authorized agent of the state board shall cancel the instrument and credit the amount of the instrument to the suspense account of the Florida Retirement System Investment Plan Trust Fund authorized under s. 121.4501(6). Any amounts transferred to the suspense account are payable upon a proper application, not to include earnings thereon, as provided in this section, within 10 years after the last day of the month in which the instrument was originally issued, after which time such amounts and any earnings attributable to employer contributions shall be forfeited.

Employees and employers participating in the Florida Retirement System collectively shall be responsible for making contributions to support the benefits provided under both plans. The employees and employers shall make contributions based upon uniform contribution rates determined as a percentage of the employee’s gross monthly compensation for the employee’s class or subclass of Florida Retirement System membership, irrespective of the retirement plan in which the individual employee is enrolled.

A change in a contribution rate is effective the first day of the month for which a full month’s employer and employee contribution may be made on or after the beginning date of the change. Beginning July 1, 2011, each employee shall contribute the contributions required in subsection (3). The employer shall deduct the contribution from the employee’s monthly salary, and the contribution shall be submitted to the division. These contributions shall be reported as employer-paid employee contributions, and credited to the account of the employee. The contributions shall be deducted from the employee’s salary before the computation of applicable federal taxes and treated as employer contributions under 26 U.S.C. s. 414(h)(2). The employer specifies that the contributions, although designated as employee contributions, are being paid by the employer in lieu of contributions by the employee. The employee does not have the option of choosing to receive the contributed amounts directly instead of having them paid by the employer to the plan. Such contributions are mandatory, and each employee is considered to have consented to payroll deductions. Payment of an employee’s salary or wages, less the contribution, is a full and complete discharge and satisfaction of all claims and demands for the service rendered by employees during the period covered by the payment, except their claims to the benefits to which they may be entitled under this chapter.</span></div><div class="Subsection"><span class="Number">(3)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">Required employee retirement contribution rates for each membership class and subclass of the Florida Retirement System for both retirement plans are as follows:</span><table width="100%" class="SpaceAbove SpaceBelow AlignLeft"><colgroup width="66%"></colgroup><colgroup width="34%"></colgroup><thead><tr><td class="VerticalAlignBottom HorizontalAlignLeft" colspan="1"><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify"><span xml:space="preserve" style="font-size: 0.8888888888888888888888888889em">Membership Class</span></span></td><td class="VerticalAlignBottom HorizontalAlignCenter" colspan="1"><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify"><span xml:space="preserve" style="font-size: 0.8888888888888888888888888889em">Percentage of<br>Gross<br>Compensation,<br>Effective<br>July 1, 2011</span></span></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" class="VerticalAlignTop HorizontalAlignLeft">&#xA0;</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="VerticalAlignBottom HorizontalAlignLeft" colspan="1"><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify"><span xml:space="preserve" style="font-size: 0.8888888888888888888888888889em">Regular Class</span></span></td><td class="VerticalAlignBottom HorizontalAlignCenter" colspan="1"><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify"><span xml:space="preserve" style="font-size: 0.8888888888888888888888888889em">3.00%</span></span></td></tr><tr><td class="VerticalAlignBottom HorizontalAlignLeft" colspan="1"><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify"><span xml:space="preserve" style="font-size: 0.8888888888888888888888888889em">Special Risk Class</span></span></td><td class="VerticalAlignBottom HorizontalAlignCenter" colspan="1"><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify"><span xml:space="preserve" style="font-size: 0.8888888888888888888888888889em">3.00%</span></span></td></tr><tr><td class="VerticalAlignBottom HorizontalAlignLeft" colspan="1"><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify"><span xml:space="preserve" style="font-size: 0.8888888888888888888888888889em">Special Risk<br>&#x2003;Administrative<br>&#x2003;Support Class</span></span></td><td class="VerticalAlignBottom HorizontalAlignCenter" colspan="1"><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify"><span xml:space="preserve" style="font-size: 0.8888888888888888888888888889em">3.00%</span></span></td></tr><tr><td class="VerticalAlignBottom HorizontalAlignLeft" colspan="1"><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify"><span xml:space="preserve" style="font-size: 0.8888888888888888888888888889em">Elected Officers’ Class<span class="EmDash">&#x2014;</span><br>&#x2003;Legislators, Governor,<br>&#x2003;Lt.
