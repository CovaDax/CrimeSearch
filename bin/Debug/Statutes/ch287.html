It is essential to the effective and ethical procurement of commodities and contractual services that there be a system of uniform procedures to be utilized by state agencies in managing and procuring commodities and contractual services; that detailed justification of agency decisions in the procurement of commodities and contractual services be maintained; and that adherence by the agency and the vendor to specific ethical considerations be required.</span></span><div class="History"><span class="HistoryTitle">History.</span><span class="EmDash">&#x2014;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="HistoryText">s. 3, ch. 82-196; s. 10, ch. 90-268; s. 7, ch. 2002-207.</span></div></div><div class="Section"><span class="SectionNumber">287.012&#x2003;</span><span class="Catchline"><span xml:space="preserve" class="CatchlineText">Definitions.</span><span class="EmDash">&#x2014;</span></span><span class="SectionBody"><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">As used in this part, the term:</span><div class="Subsection"><span class="Number">(1)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">“Agency” means any of the various state officers, departments, boards, commissions, divisions, bureaus, and councils and any other unit of organization, however designated, of the executive branch of state government. “Agency” does not include the university and college boards of trustees or the state universities and colleges.</span></div><div class="Subsection"><span class="Number">(2)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">“Agency head” means, with respect to an agency headed by a collegial body, the executive director or chief administrative officer of the agency.</span></div><div class="Subsection"><span class="Number">(3)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">“Artistic services” means the rendering by a contractor of its time and effort to create or perform an artistic work in the fields of music, dance, drama, folk art, creative writing, painting, sculpture, photography, graphic arts, craft arts, industrial design, costume design, fashion design, motion pictures, television, radio, or tape and sound recording.</span></div><div class="Subsection"><span class="Number">(4)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">“Best value” means the highest overall value to the state based on factors that include, but are not limited to, price, quality, design, and workmanship.</span></div><div class="Subsection"><span class="Number">(5)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">“Commodity” means any of the various supplies, materials, goods, merchandise, food, equipment, information technology, and other personal property, including a mobile home, trailer, or other portable structure that has less than 5,000 square feet of floor space, purchased, leased, or otherwise contracted for by the state and its agencies.
