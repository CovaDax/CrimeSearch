That act also declared it the public policy of the state to play a leading role in developing and instituting energy management programs that promote energy conservation, energy security, and the reduction of greenhouse gases. In addition to establishing policies to promote the use of renewable energy, the Legislature provided for a schedule of increases in energy performance of buildings subject to the Florida Energy Efficiency Code for Building Construction. In chapter 2008-191, Laws of Florida, the Legislature adopted new energy conservation and greenhouse gas reduction comprehensive planning requirements for local governments. In the 2008 general election, the voters of this state approved a constitutional amendment authorizing the Legislature, by general law, to prohibit consideration of any change or improvement made for the purpose of improving a property’s resistance to wind damage or the installation of a renewable energy source device in the determination of the assessed value of residential real property.</span></div><div class="Paragraph"><span class="Number">(b)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">The Legislature finds that all energy-consuming-improved properties that are not using energy conservation strategies contribute to the burden affecting all improved property resulting from fossil fuel energy production. Improved property that has been retrofitted with energy-related qualifying improvements receives the special benefit of alleviating the property’s burden from energy consumption. All improved properties not protected from wind damage by wind resistance qualifying improvements contribute to the burden affecting all improved property resulting from potential wind damage. Improved property that has been retrofitted with wind resistance qualifying improvements receives the special benefit of reducing the property’s burden from potential wind damage. Further, the installation and operation of qualifying improvements not only benefit the affected properties for which the improvements are made, but also assist in fulfilling the goals of the state’s energy and hurricane mitigation policies. In order to make qualifying improvements more affordable and assist property owners who wish to undertake such improvements, the Legislature finds that there is a compelling state interest in enabling property owners to voluntarily finance such improvements with local government assistance.</span></div><div class="Paragraph"><span class="Number">(c)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">The Legislature determines that the actions authorized under this section, including, but not limited to, the financing of qualifying improvements through the execution of financing agreements and the related imposition of voluntary assessments are reasonable and necessary to serve and achieve a compelling state interest and are necessary for the prosperity and welfare of the state and its property owners and inhabitants.</span></div></div><div class="Subsection"><span class="Number">(2)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">As used in this section, the term:</span><div class="Paragraph"><span class="Number">(a)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">“Local government” means a county, a municipality, a dependent special district as defined in s. 189.403, or a separate legal entity created pursuant to s. 163.01(7).</span></div><div class="Paragraph"><span class="Number">(b)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">“Qualifying improvement” includes any:</span><div class="SubParagraph"><span class="Number">1.&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">Energy conservation and efficiency improvement, which is a measure to reduce consumption through conservation or a more efficient use of electricity, natural gas, propane, or other forms of energy on the property, including, but not limited to, air sealing; installation of insulation; installation of energy-efficient heating, cooling, or ventilation systems; building modifications to increase the use of daylight; replacement of windows; installation of energy controls or energy recovery systems; installation of electric vehicle charging equipment; and installation of efficient lighting equipment.</span></div><div class="SubParagraph"><span class="Number">2.&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">Renewable energy improvement, which is the installation of any system in which the electrical, mechanical, or thermal energy is produced from a method that uses one or more of the following fuels or energy sources: hydrogen, solar energy, geothermal energy, bioenergy, and wind energy.</span></div><div class="SubParagraph"><span class="Number">3.&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">Wind resistance improvement, which includes, but is not limited to:</span><div class="SubSubParagraph"><span class="Number">a.&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">Improving the strength of the roof deck attachment;</span></div><div class="SubSubParagraph"><span class="Number">b.&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">Creating a secondary water barrier to prevent water intrusion;</span></div><div class="SubSubParagraph"><span class="Number">c.&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">Installing wind-resistant shingles;</span></div><div class="SubSubParagraph"><span class="Number">d.&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">Installing gable-end bracing;</span></div><div class="SubSubParagraph"><span class="Number">e.&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">Reinforcing roof-to-wall connections;</span></div><div class="SubSubParagraph"><span class="Number">f.&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">Installing storm shutters; or</span></div><div class="SubSubParagraph"><span class="Number">g.&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">Installing opening protections.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="Subsection"><span class="Number">(3)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">A local government may levy non-ad valorem assessments to fund qualifying improvements.</span></div><div class="Subsection"><span class="Number">(4)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">Subject to local government ordinance or resolution, a property owner may apply to the local government for funding to finance a qualifying improvement and enter into a financing agreement with the local government.
