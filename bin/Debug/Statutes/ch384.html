The Legislature finds that the incidence of sexually transmissible diseases is rising at an alarming rate and that these diseases result in significant social, health, and economic costs, including infant and maternal mortality, temporary and lifelong disability, and premature death. The Legislature finds that sexually transmissible diseases, by their nature, involve sensitive issues of privacy, and it is the intent of the Legislature that all programs designed to deal with these diseases afford patients privacy, confidentiality, and dignity. The Legislature finds that medical knowledge and information about sexually transmissible diseases are rapidly changing. The Legislature intends to provide a program that is sufficiently flexible to meet emerging needs, deals efficiently and effectively with reducing the incidence of sexually transmissible diseases, and provides patients with a secure knowledge that information they provide will remain private and confidential.</span></span><div class="History"><span class="HistoryTitle">History.</span><span class="EmDash">&#x2014;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="HistoryText">s. 90, ch. 86-220.</span></div></div><div class="Section"><span class="SectionNumber">384.23&#x2003;</span><span class="Catchline"><span xml:space="preserve" class="CatchlineText">Definitions.</span><span class="EmDash">&#x2014;</span></span><span class="SectionBody"><div class="Subsection"><span class="Number">(1)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">“Department” means the Department of Health.</span></div><div class="Subsection"><span class="Number">(2)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">“County health department” means agencies and entities as designated in chapter 154.</span></div><div class="Subsection"><span class="Number">(3)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">“Sexually transmissible disease” means a bacterial, viral, fungal, or parasitic disease, determined by rule of the department to be sexually transmissible, to be a threat to the public health and welfare, and to be a disease for which a legitimate public interest will be served by providing for regulation and treatment.
