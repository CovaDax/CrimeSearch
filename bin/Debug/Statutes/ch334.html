For projects on the State Highway System, the department may use state resources to participate in funding and financing the project as provided for under the department’s enabling legislation. Because the Legislature recognizes that private entities or consortia thereof would perform a governmental or public purpose or function when they enter into agreements with the department to design, build, operate, own, or finance transportation facilities, the transportation facilities, including leasehold interests thereof, are exempt from ad valorem taxes as provided in chapter 196 to the extent property is owned by the state or other government entity, and from intangible taxes as provided in chapter 199 and special assessments of the state, any city, town, county, special district, political subdivision of the state, or any other governmental entity. The private entities or consortia thereof are exempt from tax imposed by chapter 201 on all documents or obligations to pay money which arise out of the agreements to design, build, operate, own, lease, or finance transportation facilities. Any private entities or consortia thereof must pay any applicable corporate taxes as provided in chapter 220, and reemployment assistance taxes as provided in chapter 443, and sales and use tax as provided in chapter 212 shall be applicable. The private entities or consortia thereof must also register and collect the tax imposed by chapter 212 on all their direct sales and leases that are subject to tax under chapter 212. The agreement between the private entity or consortia thereof and the department establishing a transportation facility under this chapter constitutes documentation sufficient to claim any exemption under this section.</p></div><div class="Subsection"><span class="Number">(2)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">Agreements entered into pursuant to this section may authorize the private entity to impose tolls or fares for the use of the facility.
