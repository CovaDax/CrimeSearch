The assessment constitutes a lien upon the lands in the district from the effective date of the special act creating the district and must be collected by the district. If the board of supervisors determines that it is necessary to obtain funds to pay any expenses incurred or to be incurred in organizing the district, or any other expenses relating to the conduct and operation of the district, before a sufficient sum can be obtained by collecting the acreage assessment levied by this section, the board may borrow a sufficient sum of money for any of those purposes, may issue notes or bonds therefor, and may pledge any and all assessments of the initial acreage assessment levied under the provisions of this section for the repayment thereof.

The units into which the district is divided must be given appropriate numbers or names by the board of supervisors so that the units can be readily identified and distinguished. The board may fix and determine the location, area, and boundaries of the lands to be included in each unit, the type and amount of work required in the unit and the order of development, and the method of carrying on the work in each unit. The unit system provided by this section may be conducted, and all the proceedings by this section and this chapter authorized in respect to such unit or units may be carried on and conducted, whenever the board of supervisors finds that it is appropriate. If the board finds that it is advisable to implement the district infrastructure and service plans by units, as authorized by this section, the board shall, by resolution duly adopted and entered upon its minutes, declare its purpose to conduct the work accordingly, and shall proceed through the water control plan adoption or amendment process described in s. 298.301 to fix the number, location, boundaries, and description of lands within each unit or units and give them appropriate numbers or names. All provisions of this chapter shall apply within all units, and the enumeration of or reference in this section to specific powers or duties of the supervisors does not limit or restrict the application of any and all of the proceedings and powers in this chapter within all units. For water control plans applicable to one or more units, but to less than the entire district, the notices to district landowners or municipalities required under s. 298.301 need be provided only to owners of lands within the affected unit or units and municipalities within whose boundaries unit lands are located. All assessments, levies, taxes, bonds, and other obligations made, levied, assessed, or issued for or in respect to any unit or units constitute a lien and charge solely and only upon the lands in the unit or units, respectively, for the benefit of which the same have been levied, made, or issued, and not upon the remaining units or lands in the district. However, bonds may be payable from assessments imposed on more than one unit. The board of supervisors may at any time amend the location and description of lands in any unit or units by proceeding in accordance with the provisions of this section for the original creation of the unit or units. If, after the approval of the engineer’s report of benefits in any unit or units or the issuance of bonds or other obligations that are payable from taxes or assessments for benefits levied upon lands within any unit or units, the board of supervisors finds that the infrastructure or service plan for the unit or units is insufficient or inadequate for efficient development, the plan may be amended or changed and the unit or units may be amended or changed as provided in this section, by changing the location and description of lands in the unit or units, by detaching lands therefrom, or by adding lands thereto pursuant to this chapter. However, a change or amendment to a designated unit is not authorized if it has the effect of impairing a debt or other obligation of the unit or the district.</span></span><div class="History"><span class="HistoryTitle">History.</span><span class="EmDash">&#x2014;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="HistoryText">s. 21, ch. 97-40; s. 10, ch. 98-329.</span></div></div><div class="Section"><span class="SectionNumber">298.36&#x2003;</span><span class="Catchline"><span xml:space="preserve" class="CatchlineText">Lands belonging to state assessed; drainage tax record.</span><span class="EmDash">&#x2014;</span></span><span class="SectionBody"><div class="Subsection"><span class="Number">(1)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">The benefits, and all lands in said district belonging to the state, shall be assessed to, and the taxes thereon shall be paid by, the state out of funds on hand, or which may hereafter be obtained, derived from the sale of lands belonging to the state.

and praying for readjustment of the assessment of benefits for the purpose of making a more equitable basis for the levy of taxes to pay the indebtedness of such district and to maintain its drainage system, the board of supervisors shall give notice of the filing and hearing of the petition in the manner and for the time provided for in s. 298.301.</span></div><div class="Subsection"><span class="Number">(2)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">Such notice may be in the following form:</span><p xml:space="preserve" class="Indent SpaceAbove Justify">NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN to all persons interested in the lands included within the <span class="HorizontalRule TypeFixed">&#xA0;</span> Water Control District that a petition has been filed with the district, praying for a readjustment of the assessment of benefits for the purpose of making a more equitable basis for the levy of taxes against the various pieces and parcels of land in said district to pay its indebtedness and maintain its drainage system, and that said petition will be heard by the board of supervisors on the <span class="HorizontalRule TypeFixed">&#xA0;</span> day of <span class="HorizontalRule TypeFixed">&#xA0;</span>, <span xml:space="preserve" class="Directions">&#xA0;&#xA0;(year)&#xA0;&#xA0;</span>.</p><p xml:space="preserve" class="Indent Justify">Dated <span class="HorizontalRule TypeFixed">&#xA0;</span>, <span xml:space="preserve" class="Directions">&#xA0;&#xA0;(year)&#xA0;&#xA0;</span>.</p><p xml:space="preserve" class="AlignRight Justify"><span xml:space="preserve" class="Directions">&#xA0;&#xA0;(Secretary of District)&#xA0;&#xA0;</span></p><p xml:space="preserve" class="AlignRight SpaceBelow Justify"><span class="HorizontalRule TypeFixed">&#xA0;</span> County</p></div><div class="Subsection"><span class="Number">(3)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">Any interested person may file an answer to the petition before the return day and, if so, shall be duly heard, but, if not, the cause shall proceed ex parte.

Thereupon, the board of supervisors shall proceed pursuant to s. 298.301 to make such readjustment of assessment of benefits to each piece or parcel of land which has accrued or will accrue as a result of the drainage system. Provided, in making the readjustment of the assessment of benefits, the board of supervisors shall not increase the existing assessment, or unpaid portion thereof, on any piece or parcel of land; provided, further, that after the making of such readjustment, the limitation of 10 percent of the annual maintenance tax which may be levied shall apply to the amount of benefits as readjusted.</span></div></span><div class="History"><span class="HistoryTitle">History.</span><span class="EmDash">&#x2014;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="HistoryText">s. 1, ch. 22103, 1943; s. 34, ch. 79-5; s. 6, ch. 80-281; s. 25, ch. 97-40; s. 22, ch. 99-6; s. 5, ch. 2005-238.</span></div></div><div class="Section"><span class="SectionNumber">298.78&#x2003;</span><span class="Catchline"><span xml:space="preserve" class="CatchlineText">Lien; release.</span><span class="EmDash">&#x2014;</span></span><span class="SectionBody"><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">Any landowner shall have right at any time within 90 days after the date of said decree, or at any time thereafter with consent of holders of not less than 95 percent of bonds, to obtain a full release of his or her lands from the lien and liability of the assessment by the payment of an amount to be stated in the decree, which shall include the proportionate amount of the indebtedness chargeable against said piece or parcel of land, together with an additional amount estimated to be required to pay the bonds by reason of the failure of other pieces or parcels to pay the indebtedness so charged against them, said amounts to be approved by holders of not less than 95 percent of bonds.</span></span><div class="History"><span class="HistoryTitle">History.</span><span class="EmDash">&#x2014;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="HistoryText">s. 2, ch. 22103, 1943; s. 275, ch. 95-148.</span></div></div></div></div></body></html></font>
