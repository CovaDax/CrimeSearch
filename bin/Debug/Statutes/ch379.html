class="EmDash">&#x2014;</span></span><span class="SectionBody"><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">The Wildlife Violator Compact is created and entered into with all other jurisdictions legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows:</span><p xml:space="preserve" class="AlignCenter SpaceAbove Justify">ARTICLE I</p><p xml:space="preserve" class="AlignCenter Justify">Findings and Purpose</p><p xml:space="preserve" class="Indent SpaceAbove Justify">(1)&#x2003;The participating states find that:</p><p xml:space="preserve" class="Indent Justify">(a)&#x2003;Wildlife resources are managed in trust by the respective states for the benefit of all residents and visitors.</p><p xml:space="preserve" class="Indent Justify">(b)&#x2003;The protection of the wildlife resources of a state is materially affected by the degree of compliance with state statutes, laws, regulations, ordinances, and administrative rules relating to the management of such resources.</p><p xml:space="preserve" class="Indent Justify">(c)&#x2003;The preservation, protection, management, and restoration of wildlife contributes immeasurably to the aesthetic, recreational, and economic aspects of such natural resources.</p><p xml:space="preserve" class="Indent Justify">(d)&#x2003;Wildlife resources are valuable without regard to political boundaries; therefore, every person should be required to comply with wildlife preservation, protection, management, and restoration laws, ordinances, and administrative rules and regulations of the participating states as a condition precedent to the continuance or issuance of any license to hunt, fish, trap, or possess wildlife.</p><p xml:space="preserve" class="Indent Justify">(e)&#x2003;Violation of wildlife laws interferes with the management of wildlife resources and may endanger the safety of persons and property.</p><p xml:space="preserve" class="Indent Justify">(f)&#x2003;The mobility of many wildlife law violators necessitates the maintenance of channels of communication among the various states.</p><p xml:space="preserve" class="Indent Justify">(g)&#x2003;In most instances, a person who is cited for a wildlife violation in a state other than his or her home state is:</p><p xml:space="preserve" class="Indent Justify">1.&#x2003;Required to post collateral or a bond to secure appearance for a trial at a later date;</p><p xml:space="preserve" class="Indent Justify">2.&#x2003;Taken into custody until the collateral or bond is posted; or</p><p xml:space="preserve" class="Indent Justify">3.&#x2003;Taken directly to court for an immediate appearance.</p><p xml:space="preserve" class="Indent Justify">(h)&#x2003;The purpose of the enforcement practices set forth in paragraph (g) is to ensure compliance with the terms of a wildlife citation by the cited person who, if permitted to continue on his or her way after receiving the citation, could return to his or her home state and disregard his or her duty under the terms of the citation.</p><p xml:space="preserve" class="Indent Justify">(i)&#x2003;In most instances, a person receiving a wildlife citation in his or her home state is permitted to accept the citation from the officer at the scene of the violation and immediately continue on his or her way after agreeing or being instructed to comply with the terms of the citation.</p><p xml:space="preserve" class="Indent Justify">(j)&#x2003;The practices described in paragraph (g) cause unnecessary inconvenience and, at times, a hardship for the person who is unable at the time to post collateral, furnish a bond, stand trial, or pay a fine, and thus is compelled to remain in custody until some alternative arrangement is made.</p><p xml:space="preserve" class="Indent Justify">(k)&#x2003;The enforcement practices described in paragraph (g) consume an undue amount of time of law enforcement agencies.</p><p xml:space="preserve" class="Indent Justify">(2)&#x2003;It is the policy of the participating states to:</p><p xml:space="preserve" class="Indent Justify">(a)&#x2003;Promote compliance with the statutes, laws, ordinances, regulations, and administrative rules relating to the management of wildlife resources in their respective states.</p><p xml:space="preserve" class="Indent Justify">(b)&#x2003;Recognize a suspension of the wildlife license privileges of any person whose license privileges have been suspended by a participating state and treat such suspension as if it had occurred in each respective state.</p><p xml:space="preserve" class="Indent Justify">(c)&#x2003;Allow a violator, except as provided in subsection (2) of Article III, to accept a wildlife citation and, without delay, proceed on his or her way, whether or not the violator is a resident of the state in which the citation was issued, if the violator’s home state is party to this compact.</p><p xml:space="preserve" class="Indent Justify">(d)&#x2003;Report to the appropriate participating state, as provided in the compact manual, any conviction recorded against any person whose home state was not the issuing state.</p><p xml:space="preserve" class="Indent Justify">(e)&#x2003;Allow the home state to recognize and treat convictions recorded against its residents, which convictions occurred in a participating state, as though they had occurred in the home state.</p><p xml:space="preserve" class="Indent Justify">(f)&#x2003;Extend cooperation to its fullest extent among the participating states for enforcing compliance with the terms of a wildlife citation issued in one participating state to a resident of another participating state.</p><p xml:space="preserve" class="Indent Justify">(g)&#x2003;Maximize the effective use of law enforcement personnel and information.</p><p xml:space="preserve" class="Indent Justify">(h)&#x2003;Assist court systems in the efficient disposition of wildlife violations.</p><p xml:space="preserve" class="Indent Justify">(3)&#x2003;The purpose of this compact is to:</p><p xml:space="preserve" class="Indent Justify">(a)&#x2003;Provide a means through which participating states may join in a reciprocal program to effectuate the policies enumerated in subsection (2) in a uniform and orderly manner.</p><p xml:space="preserve" class="Indent Justify">(b)&#x2003;Provide for the fair and impartial treatment of wildlife violators operating within participating states in recognition of the violator’s right to due process and the sovereign status of a participating state.</p><p xml:space="preserve" class="AlignCenter SpaceAbove Justify">ARTICLE II</p><p xml:space="preserve"

In an effort to solve these and related problems, the Legislature intends to develop pursuant to the provisions of this section a spiny lobster trap certificate program, the principal goal of which is to stabilize the fishery by reducing the total number of traps, which should increase the yield per trap and therefore maintain or increase overall catch levels.

In determining whether to establish such a rent and, if so, the amount thereof, the commission shall consider the amount of revenues annually generated by certificate fees, transfer fees, surcharges, trap license fees, and sales taxes, the demonstrated fair market value of transferred certificates, and the continued economic viability of the commercial lobster industry.

The Florida Conflict Resolution Consortium shall pay all of the costs of the mediator and for up to 8 hours of the mediator’s time per case at $150 per hour. Upon notice from the respondent, the Florida Conflict Resolution Consortium shall provide the respondent with a panel of possible mediators from the area in which the hearing on the petition would be heard. The respondent shall select the mediator and notify the Florida Conflict Resolution Consortium of the selection within 15 days after receipt of the proposed panel of mediators. The Florida Conflict Resolution Consortium shall provide all of the administrative support for the mediation process. The mediation must be completed at least 15 days before the final hearing date set by the administrative law judge.</span></div><div class="Paragraph"><span class="Number">(f)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">In any administrative proceeding brought by the commission, the prevailing party shall recover all costs as provided in ss. 57.041 and 57.071. The costs must be included in the final order. The respondent is the prevailing party when an order is entered awarding no penalties to the commission and the order has not been reversed on appeal or the time for seeking judicial review has expired. The respondent is entitled to an award of attorney’s fees if the administrative law judge determines that the notice of violation issued by the commission was not substantially justified as defined in s. 57.111(3)(e). An award of attorney’s fees as provided by this subsection may not exceed $15,000.</span></div><div class="Paragraph"><span class="Number">(g)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">This section does not prevent any other legal or administrative action in accordance with law. This subsection does not limit the commission’s authority set forth in this section and ss. 379.503 and 379.504 to judicially pursue injunctive relief. If the commission exercises its authority to judicially pursue injunctive relief, penalties in any amount up to the statutory maximum sought by the commission must be pursued as part of the state court action and not by initiating a separate administrative proceeding. The commission retains the authority to judicially pursue penalties in excess of $10,000 for violations not specifically included in the administrative penalty schedule, or for multiple or multiday violations alleged to exceed a total of $10,000. The commission also retains the authority provided in this section and ss. 379.503 and 379.504 to judicially pursue injunctive relief and damages, if a notice of violation seeking the imposition of administrative penalties has not been issued. The commission may enter into a settlement before or after initiating a notice of violation, and the settlement may include a penalty amount that is different from the administrative penalty schedule. Any case filed in state court because it is alleged to exceed a total of $10,000 in penalties may be settled in the court action for less than $10,000.</span></div><div class="Paragraph"><span class="Number">(h)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">The provisions of chapter 120 shall apply to any administrative action taken by the commission under this section or any delegated program pursuing administrative penalties in accordance with this section.</span></div></div><div class="Subsection"><span class="Number">(3)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">Administrative penalties must be calculated according to the following schedule:</span><div class="Paragraph"><span class="Number">(a)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">For violations of s. 379.501(1)(a) or (b), $3,000.</span></div><div class="Paragraph"><span class="Number">(b)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">For failure to conduct required monitoring or testing in compliance with a permit, $2,000.</span></div><div class="Paragraph"><span class="Number">(c)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">For failure to prepare, submit, maintain, or use required reports or other required documentation, $500.</span></div><div class="Paragraph"><span class="Number">(d)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">For failure to comply with any other regulatory statute or rule requirement relating to the administration of the commission’s powers under s. 369.20 or s. 369.22 not otherwise identified in this section, $500.</span></div></div><div class="Subsection"><span class="Number">(4)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">For each additional day during which a violation occurs, the administrative penalties in subsection (3) may be assessed per day, per violation.</span></div><div class="Subsection"><span class="Number">(5)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">The history of noncompliance of the violator for any previous violation resulting in an executed consent order, but not including a consent order entered into without a finding of violation, or resulting in a final order or judgment on or after July 1, 2009, involving the imposition of $2,000 or more in penalties, shall be taken into consideration in the following manner:</span><div class="Paragraph"><span class="Number">(a)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">One previous such violation within 5 years prior to the filing of the notice of violation shall result in a 25-percent per day increase in the scheduled administrative penalty.</span></div><div class="Paragraph"><span class="Number">(b)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">Two previous such violations within 5 years prior to the filing of the notice of violation shall result in a 50-percent per day increase in the scheduled administrative penalty.</span></div><div class="Paragraph"><span class="Number">(c)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">Three or more previous such violations within 5 years before the filing of the notice of violation shall result in a 100-percent per day increase in the scheduled administrative penalty.</span></div></div><div class="Subsection"><span class="Number">(6)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">The direct economic benefit gained by the violator from the violation shall be added to the scheduled administrative penalty.
