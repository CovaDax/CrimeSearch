To accomplish these objectives, metropolitan planning organizations, referred to in this section as M.P.O.’s, shall develop, in cooperation with the state and public transit operators, transportation plans and programs for metropolitan areas.

The process for developing such plans and programs shall provide for consideration of all modes of transportation and shall be continuing, cooperative, and comprehensive, to the degree appropriate, based on the complexity of the transportation problems to be addressed. To ensure that the process is integrated with the statewide planning process, M.P.O.’s shall develop plans and programs that identify transportation facilities that should function as an integrated metropolitan transportation system, giving emphasis to facilities that serve important national, state, and regional transportation functions. For the purposes of this section, those facilities include the facilities on the Strategic Intermodal System designated under s. 339.63 and facilities for which projects have been identified pursuant to s. 339.2819(4).</span></div><div class="Subsection"><span class="Number">(2)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">DESIGNATION.<span class="EmDash">&#x2014;</span></span><div class="Paragraph"><div class="SubParagraph"><span class="Number">(a)1.&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">An M.P.O. shall be designated for each urbanized area of the state; however, this does not require that an individual M.P.O. be designated for each such area.

The Legislature also finds that the state’s growing regional and intercity economic centers will increase the demand for interregional and intercity travel and that the evolving service-based and information-based industries will change the type of transportation system that business and industry demand, increasing the importance of speed and reliability. The Legislature further finds that our transportation system must be designed and operated in such a way that it preserves the abundance of natural and manmade amenities that have been so successful in attracting new residents, businesses, and tourists to this state. Therefore, the Legislature declares that the designation of a strategic intermodal system, composed of facilities and services of statewide and interregional significance, will efficiently serve the mobility needs of Florida’s citizens, businesses, and visitors and will help Florida become a worldwide economic leader, enhance economic prosperity and competitiveness, enrich quality of life, and reflect responsible environmental stewardship. To that end, it is the intent of the Legislature that the Strategic Intermodal System consist of transportation facilities that meet a strategic and essential state interest and that limited resources available for the implementation of statewide and interregional transportation priorities be focused on that system.</span></div><div class="Subsection"><span class="Number">(3)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">Funds paid into the State Transportation Trust Fund pursuant to s. 201.15 for the purposes of the Florida Strategic Intermodal System are hereby annually appropriated for expenditure to support that program.</span></div></span><div class="History"><span class="HistoryTitle">History.</span><span class="EmDash">&#x2014;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="HistoryText">s. 46, ch. 2003-286;
