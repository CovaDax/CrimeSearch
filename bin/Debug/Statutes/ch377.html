The summons shall contain the style and number of the suit and a very brief statement of the nature of the cause of action. It shall be served by posting one copy thereof at the courthouse door of the county where the commodity involved in the suit is alleged to be located and by posting another copy thereof near the place where the commodity is alleged to be located. One copy of such summons shall be posted at least 5 days before the return day stated therein, and the posting of such copy shall constitute constructive possession of such commodity by the state. A copy of the summons shall also be published once each week for 4 successive weeks in some newspaper published in the county where the suit is pending and having a bona fide circulation therein if such a newspaper is published. No judgment shall be pronounced by any court condemning such commodity as contraband until after the lapse of 5 days from the last publication or posting of said summons.

Such order of seizure shall specifically describe the illegal oil, illegal gas, or illegal product, so that the same may be identified with reasonable certainty. It shall direct the sheriff to whom it is addressed to take into his or her custody, actual or constructive, the illegal oil, illegal gas, or illegal product described therein, and to hold the same subject to the orders of the court.

that the impacts of global climate change can be reduced through the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions; and that the implementation of alternative energy technologies can be a source of new jobs and employment opportunities for many Floridians. The Legislature further finds that the state is positioned at the front line against potential impacts of global climate change. Human and economic costs of those impacts can be averted by global actions and, where necessary, adapted to by a concerted effort to make Florida’s communities more resilient and less vulnerable to these impacts. In focusing the government’s policy and efforts to benefit and protect our state, its citizens, and its resources, the Legislature believes that a single government entity with a specific focus on energy and climate change is both desirable and advantageous. Further, the Legislature finds that energy infrastructure provides the foundation for secure and reliable access to the energy supplies and services on which Florida depends. Therefore, there is significant value to Florida consumers that comes from investment in Florida’s energy infrastructure that increases system reliability, enhances energy independence and diversification, stabilizes energy costs, and reduces greenhouse gas emissions.</span></div><div class="Subsection"><span class="Number">(2)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">It is the policy of the State of Florida to:</span><div class="Paragraph"><span class="Number">(a)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">Develop and promote the effective use of energy in the state, discourage all forms of energy waste, and recognize and address the potential of global climate change wherever possible.</span></div><div class="Paragraph"><span class="Number">(b)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">Play a leading role in developing and instituting energy management programs aimed at promoting energy conservation, energy security, and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.</span></div><div class="Paragraph"><span class="Number">(c)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">Include energy considerations in all state, regional, and local planning.</span></div><div class="Paragraph"><span class="Number">(d)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">Utilize and manage effectively energy resources used within state agencies.</span></div><div class="Paragraph"><span class="Number">(e)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">Encourage local governments to include energy considerations in all planning and to support their work in promoting energy management programs.</span></div><div class="Paragraph"><span class="Number">(f)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">Include the full participation of citizens in the development and implementation of energy programs.</span></div><div class="Paragraph"><span class="Number">(g)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">Consider in its decisions the energy needs of each economic sector, including residential, industrial, commercial, agricultural, and governmental uses, and reduce those needs whenever possible.</span></div><div class="Paragraph"><span class="Number">(h)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">Promote energy education and the public dissemination of information on energy and its environmental, economic, and social impact.</span></div><div class="Paragraph"><span class="Number">(i)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">Encourage the research, development, demonstration, and application of alternative energy resources, particularly renewable energy resources.</span></div><div class="Paragraph"><span class="Number">(j)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">Consider, in its decisionmaking, the social, economic, and environmental impacts of energy-related activities, including the whole-life-cycle impacts of any potential energy use choices, so that detrimental effects of these activities are understood and minimized.</span></div><div class="Paragraph"><span class="Number">(k)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">Develop and maintain energy emergency preparedness plans to minimize the effects of an energy shortage within Florida.</span></div></div></span><div class="History"><span class="HistoryTitle">History.</span><span class="EmDash">&#x2014;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="HistoryText">s. 1, ch. 74-186;

Such exemptions are intended to foster the development of solid waste management facilities that generate electricity and provide incentives for the development of environmentally sound methods of disposing of solid wastes without imposing undue risk or cost to electric consumers in this state. The commission shall authorize levelized payments for purchase of capacity or energy from a local government solid waste management facility.
