In achieving this objective, the state will seek to provide appropriate investments, tax benefits, and regulatory relief of sufficient importance to encourage the business community to commit its financial participation. The purpose of ss. 290.001-290.016 is to establish a process that clearly identifies such severely distressed areas and provides incentives by both the state and local government to induce private investment in such areas. The Legislature, therefore, declares the revitalization of enterprise zones, through the concerted efforts of government and the private sector, to be a public purpose.</span></span><div class="History"><span class="HistoryTitle">History.</span><span class="EmDash">&#x2014;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="HistoryText">s. 1, ch. 82-119; ss. 44, 57, ch. 84-356; ss. 18, 37, ch. 94-136; s. 11, ch. 2005-287.</span></div><div class="Note"><sup><a name="1">1</a></sup><span class="NoteTitle">Note.</span><span class="EmDash">&#x2014;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">Repealed December 31, 2015, by s. 11, ch. 2005-287.</span></div></div><div class="Section"><sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup><span class="SectionNumber">290.004&#x2003;</span><span class="Catchline"><span xml:space="preserve" class="CatchlineText">Definitions relating to Florida Enterprise Zone Act.</span><span class="EmDash">&#x2014;</span></span><span class="SectionBody"><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">As used in ss. 290.001-290.016:</span><div class="Subsection"><span class="Number">(1)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">“Community investment corporation” means a black business investment corporation, a certified development corporation, a small business investment corporation, or other similar entity incorporated under Florida law that has limited its investment policy to making investments solely in minority business enterprises.</span></div><div class="Subsection"><span class="Number">(2)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">“Department” means the Department of Economic Opportunity.</span></div><div class="Subsection"><span class="Number">(3)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">“Governing body” means the council or other legislative body charged with governing the county or municipality.</span></div><div class="Subsection"><span class="Number">(4)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">“Minority business enterprise” has the same meaning as provided in s. 288.703.</span></div><div class="Subsection"><span class="Number">(5)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">“Rural enterprise zone” means an enterprise zone that is nominated by a county having a population of 75,000 or fewer, or a county having a population of 100,000 or fewer which is contiguous to a county having a population of 75,000 or fewer, or by a municipality in such a county, or by such a county and one or more municipalities.
