However, until the Governor either appoints or rejects the application for appointment of a person as a special officer, the railroad or common carrier may temporarily employ the person as a special officer if he or she complies with the qualifications for employment as a law enforcement officer in s. 943.13. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a special officer must have the same training as a law enforcement officer in accordance with ss. 943.13 and 943.135(1). A Class I, Class II, or Class III railroad shall be considered an employing agency for purposes of ss. 943.13 and 943.135(1), and shall pay all costs associated with the training and continuing education of employed special officers.</span></span><div class="History"><span class="HistoryTitle">History.</span><span class="EmDash">&#x2014;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="HistoryText">s. 1, ch. 8539, 1921;
