The Legislature further finds that while it is not practicable to extract resources without disturbing the surface of the earth and producing waste materials, and that the very character of certain surface extraction operations precludes complete restoration of the land to its original contour, it is essential to require reclamation to mitigate the effects of resource extraction on the environment.</span></div><div class="Subsection"><span class="Number">(2)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">The Legislature recognizes that there are wide variations in the circumstances and conditions surrounding and arising out of the extraction process and that the rehabilitation and conservation of resources will be assured only through proper planning and through consideration of the impact of resource extraction upon the environment as well as upon the land use of the surrounding areas.

The Legislature further recognizes that it is in the best interest of the state that the reclamation process be accomplished in a timely manner and that persons engaged in resource extraction shall be responsible for attaining required reclamation standards.
