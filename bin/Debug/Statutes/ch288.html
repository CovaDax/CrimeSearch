The Legislature also finds that incentives narrowly focused in application and scope tend to be more effective in achieving the state’s economic development goals. The Legislature further finds that higher-wage jobs reduce the state’s share of hidden costs, such as public assistance and subsidized health care associated with low-wage jobs. Therefore, the Legislature declares that it is the policy of the state to encourage the growth of higher-wage jobs and a diverse economic base by providing state tax refunds to qualified target industry businesses that originate or expand in the state or that relocate to the state.</span></div><div class="Subsection"><span class="Number">(2)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">DEFINITIONS.<span class="EmDash">&#x2014;</span>As used in this section:</span><div class="Paragraph"><span class="Number">(a)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">“Account” means the Economic Development Incentives Account within the Economic Development Trust Fund established under s. 288.095.</span></div><div class="Paragraph"><span class="Number">(b)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">“Authorized local economic development agency” means a public or private entity, including an entity defined in s. 288.075, authorized by a county or municipality to promote the general business or industrial interests of that county or municipality.</span></div><div class="Paragraph"><span class="Number">(c)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">“Average private sector wage in the area” means the statewide private sector average wage or the average of all private sector wages and salaries in the county or in the standard metropolitan area in which the business is located.</span></div><div class="Paragraph"><span class="Number">(d)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">“Business” means an employing unit, as defined in s. 443.036, that is registered for reemployment assistance purposes with the state agency providing reemployment assistance tax collection services under an interagency agreement pursuant to s. 443.1316, or a subcategory or division of an employing unit that is accepted by the state agency providing reemployment assistance tax collection services as a reporting unit.</span></div><div class="Paragraph"><span class="Number">(e)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">“Corporate headquarters business” means an international, national, or regional headquarters office of a multinational or multistate business enterprise or national trade association, whether separate from or connected with other facilities used by such business.</span></div><div class="Paragraph"><span class="Number">(f)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">“Enterprise zone” means an area designated as an enterprise zone pursuant to s. 290.0065.</span></div><div class="Paragraph"><span class="Number">(g)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">“Expansion of an existing business” means the expansion of an existing Florida business by or through additions to real and personal property, resulting in a net increase in employment of not less than 10 percent at such business.</span></div><div class="Paragraph"><span class="Number">(h)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">“Fiscal year” means the fiscal year of the state.</span></div><div class="Paragraph"><span class="Number">(i)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">“Jobs” means full-time equivalent positions, including, but not limited to, positions obtained from a temporary employment agency or employee leasing company or through a union agreement or coemployment under a professional employer organization agreement, that result directly from a project in this state.

The Legislature further finds that these businesses could be assisted through the establishment of a Florida Export Finance Corporation designed to work with the United States Export-Import Bank, Small Business Administration, Foreign Credit Insurance Association, Overseas Private Investment Corporation, Private Export Funding Corporation, and other federal, state, and private agencies and institutions to provide Florida traders with information, technical assistance, and financial support. It is the intention of the Legislature to expand job opportunities for Florida’s workforce. Furthermore, it is the intention of the Legislature to avoid duplicating existing programs, and to coordinate, assist, augment, and improve the access to those programs by Florida-based small and medium-sized businesses and to promote Florida products and services in the international marketplace.</span></span><div class="History"><span class="HistoryTitle">History.</span><span class="EmDash">&#x2014;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="HistoryText">s. 47, ch. 93-187.</span></div></div><div class="Section"><span class="SectionNumber">288.772&#x2003;</span><span class="Catchline"><span xml:space="preserve" class="CatchlineText">Definitions.</span><span class="EmDash">&#x2014;</span></span><span class="SectionBody"><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">For purposes of ss. 288.771-288.778:</span><div class="Subsection"><span class="Number">(1)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">“Account” means the Florida Export Finance Corporation account in the Florida Intergovernmental Relations Foundation, Inc.</span></div><div class="Subsection"><span class="Number">(2)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">“Board” means the board of directors of the Florida Export Finance Corporation.</span></div><div class="Subsection"><span class="Number">(3)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">“Corporation” means the Florida Export Finance Corporation.</span></div><div class="Subsection"><span class="Number">(4)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">“Domiciled in this state” means registered to do business in this state.</span></div><div class="Subsection"><span class="Number">(5)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">“Financial institution” shall have the same meaning as that term is defined in s. 655.005.</span></div><div class="Subsection"><span class="Number">(6)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">“President” means the chief executive officer of the Florida Export Finance Corporation.</span></div><div class="Subsection"><span class="Number">(7)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">“Small and medium-sized businesses” or “businesses” means businesses domiciled in this state which employ less than 250 people and have a net worth of less than $6 million.</span></div></span><div class="History"><span class="HistoryTitle">History.</span><span class="EmDash">&#x2014;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="HistoryText">s. 48, ch. 93-187; s. 68, ch. 96-320; s. 21, ch. 97-278; s. 32, ch. 2011-194.</span></div></div><div class="Section"><span class="SectionNumber">288.773&#x2003;</span><span class="Catchline"><span xml:space="preserve" class="CatchlineText">Florida Export Finance Corporation.</span><span class="EmDash">&#x2014;</span></span><span class="SectionBody"><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">The Florida Export Finance Corporation is hereby created as a corporation not for profit, to be incorporated under the provisions of chapter 617 and approved by the Department of State.
