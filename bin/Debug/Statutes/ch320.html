A motor vehicle dealer may apply for a certificate of title to a motor vehicle required to be registered under s. 320.08(2)(b), (c), and (d), using a manufacturer’s statement of origin as permitted by s. 319.23(1), only if such dealer is authorized by a franchised agreement as defined in s. 320.60(1), to buy, sell, or deal in such vehicle and is authorized by such agreement to perform delivery and preparation obligations and warranty defect adjustments on the motor vehicle; provided this limitation shall not apply to recreational vehicles, van conversions, or any other motor vehicle manufactured on a truck chassis.

Such application shall describe the exact location of the place of business and shall state whether the place of business is owned by the applicant and when acquired, or, if leased, a true copy of the lease shall be attached to the application. The applicant shall certify that the location provides an adequately equipped office and is not a residence; that the location affords sufficient unoccupied space upon and within which adequately to store all motor vehicles offered and displayed for sale; and that the location is a suitable place where the applicant can in good faith carry on such business and keep and maintain books, records, and files necessary to conduct such business, which shall be available at all reasonable hours to inspection by the department or any of its inspectors or other employees. The applicant shall certify that the business of a motor vehicle dealer is the principal business which shall be conducted at that location. The application shall contain a statement that the applicant is either franchised by a manufacturer of motor vehicles, in which case the name of each motor vehicle that the applicant is franchised to sell shall be included, or an independent (nonfranchised) motor vehicle dealer. The application shall contain other relevant information as may be required by the department, including evidence that the applicant is insured under a garage liability insurance policy or a general liability insurance policy coupled with a business automobile policy, which shall include, at a minimum, $25,000 combined single-limit liability coverage including bodily injury and property damage protection and $10,000 personal injury protection. However, a salvage motor vehicle dealer as defined in subparagraph (1)(c)5. is exempt from the requirements for garage liability insurance and personal injury protection insurance on those vehicles that cannot be legally operated on roads, highways, or streets in this state. Franchise dealers must submit a garage liability insurance policy, and all other dealers must submit a garage liability insurance policy or a general liability insurance policy coupled with a business automobile policy. Such policy shall be for the license period, and evidence of a new or continued policy shall be delivered to the department at the beginning of each license period. Upon making initial application, the applicant shall pay to the department a fee of $300 in addition to any other fees required by law. Applicants may choose to extend the licensure period for 1 additional year for a total of 2 years. An initial applicant shall pay to the department a fee of $300 for the first year and $75 for the second year, in addition to any other fees required by law. An applicant for renewal shall pay to the department $75 for a 1-year renewal or $150 for a 2-year renewal, in addition to any other fees required by law. Upon making an application for a change of location, the person shall pay a fee of $50 in addition to any other fees now required by law. The department shall, in the case of every application for initial licensure, verify whether certain facts set forth in the application are true. Each applicant, general partner in the case of a partnership, or corporate officer and director in the case of a corporate applicant, must file a set of fingerprints with the department for the purpose of determining any prior criminal record or any outstanding warrants. The department shall submit the fingerprints to the Department of Law Enforcement for state processing and forwarding to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for federal processing. The actual cost of state and federal processing shall be borne by the applicant and is in addition to the fee for licensure.

The actual cost of each original, additional, or replacement computerized card shall be borne by the licensee and is in addition to the fee for licensure. Such license, when so issued, entitles the licensee to carry on and conduct the business of a motor vehicle dealer. Each license issued to a franchise motor vehicle dealer expires on December 31 of the year of its expiration unless revoked or suspended prior to that date. Each license issued to an independent or wholesale dealer or auction expires on April 30 of the year of its expiration unless revoked or suspended prior to that date. At least 60 days before the license expiration date, the department shall deliver or mail to each licensee the necessary renewal forms. Each independent dealer shall certify that the dealer (owner, partner, officer, or director of the licensee, or a full-time employee of the licensee that holds a responsible management-level position) has completed 8 hours of continuing education prior to filing the renewal forms with the department. Such certification shall be filed once every 2 years. The continuing education shall include at least 2 hours of legal or legislative issues, 1 hour of department issues, and 5 hours of relevant motor vehicle industry topics. Continuing education shall be provided by dealer schools licensed under paragraph (b) either in a classroom setting or by correspondence. Such schools shall provide certificates of completion to the department and the customer which shall be filed with the license renewal form, and such schools may charge a fee for providing continuing education. Any licensee who does not file his or her application and fees and any other requisite documents, as required by law, with the department at least 30 days prior to the license expiration date shall cease to engage in business as a motor vehicle dealer on the license expiration date. A renewal filed with the department within 45 days after the expiration date shall be accompanied by a delinquent fee of $100. Thereafter, a new application is required, accompanied by the initial license fee. A license certificate duly issued by the department may be modified by endorsement to show a change in the name of the licensee, provided, as shown by affidavit of the licensee, the majority ownership interest of the licensee has not changed or the name of the person appearing as franchisee on the sales and service agreement has not changed. Modification of a license certificate to show any name change as herein provided shall not require initial licensure or reissuance of dealer tags; however, any dealer obtaining a name change shall transact all business in and be properly identified by that name. All documents relative to licensure shall reflect the new name. In the case of a franchise dealer, the name change shall be approved by the manufacturer, distributor, or importer. A licensee applying for a name change endorsement shall pay a fee of $25 which fee shall apply to the change in the name of a main location and all additional locations licensed under the provisions of subsection (5). Each initial license application received by the department shall be accompanied by verification that, within the preceding 6 months, the applicant, or one or more of his or her designated employees, has attended a training and information seminar conducted by a licensed motor vehicle dealer training school. Any applicant for a new franchised motor vehicle dealer license who has held a valid franchised motor vehicle dealer license continuously for the past 2 years and who remains in good standing with the department is exempt from the prelicensing training requirement. Such seminar shall include, but is not limited to, statutory dealer requirements, which requirements include required bookkeeping and recordkeeping procedures, requirements for the collection of sales and use taxes, and such other information that in the opinion of the department will promote good business practices.

Such training must include training in titling and registration of motor vehicles, laws relating to unfair and deceptive trade practices, laws relating to financing with regard to buy-here, pay-here operations, and such other information that in the opinion of the department will promote good business practices. Successful completion of this training shall be determined by examination administered at the end of the course and attendance of no less than 90 percent of the total hours required by such school. Any applicant who had held a valid motor vehicle dealer’s license continuously within the past 2 years and who remains in good standing with the department is exempt from the prelicensing requirements of this section.
