The Legislature further finds that rapid increases in population and development throughout Florida threaten the integrity of the environment and limit opportunities for citizens and visitors to enjoy the state’s natural areas. The Legislature further finds that inappropriate and poorly planned land uses overburden natural resources and disrupt the state’s ecology. Finally, the Legislature finds that the quality of life, environmental quality, as well as the viability and vitality of the urban areas of this state are directly linked to urban open space and greenways. The creation of greenways; expansion of green spaces; enhancement of recreation areas; preservation of working waterfronts; and protection and restoration of urban lakes, rivers, and watersheds in the urban areas of this state are necessary to link populated areas with natural areas, preserve unique cultural and heritage sites, provide land for recreational opportunities to enhance the health and well-being of the urban residents of this state, improve water quality, reduce the level of urban crime and violence, and build confidence and self-esteem among the urban youth of this state.</span></div><div class="Subsection"><span class="Number">(2)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">The Legislature recognizes that the primary responsibility for establishing well-planned land use rests at the local government level through the implementation of comprehensive plans.
