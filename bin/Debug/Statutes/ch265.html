Loans of such property are made to these museums for study or display in furtherance of their educational purposes. However, problems arise in relation to loans for indefinite or long terms when museums and lenders fail to maintain contact. Museums routinely store and care for loaned property long after loan periods have expired or should reasonably be deemed expired. In such circumstances, museums have limited rights to the use and treatment of unclaimed loan property, while at the same time they bear substantial unreimbursed expenses, including, but not limited to, costs related to storage, recordkeeping, climate control, security, periodic inspection, insurance, conservation, and general overhead. The Legislature finds and declares that it is in the public interest to establish uniform procedures governing the disposition of unclaimed property on loan to museums in the state and, more particularly, to encourage museums and their lenders to exercise due diligence in monitoring loans, to allocate fairly responsibilities between lenders and borrowing museums, to establish procedures for lenders to preserve their interests in property loaned to museums for indefinite or long terms, and to resolve expeditiously the title to unclaimed loans left in the custody of museums.</span></div><div class="Subsection"><span class="Number">(2)&#x2003;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="Text Intro Justify">DEFINITIONS.<span class="EmDash">&#x2014;</span></span><div
