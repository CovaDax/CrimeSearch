However, if the damaged motor vehicle is equipped with custom-lowered floors for wheelchair access or a wheelchair lift, the insurance company may, upon determining that the vehicle is repairable to a condition that is safe for operation on public roads, submit the certificate of title to the department for reissuance as a salvage rebuildable title and the addition of a title brand of “insurance-declared total loss.” The certificate of destruction shall be reassignable a maximum of two times before dismantling or destruction of the vehicle shall be required, and shall accompany the motor vehicle or mobile home for which it is issued, when such motor vehicle or mobile home is sold for such purposes, in lieu of a certificate of title, and, thereafter, the department shall refuse issuance of any certificate of title for that vehicle.
